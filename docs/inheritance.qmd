## Configuration Inheritance

Inspect Flow supports configuration inheritance through two mechanisms:

### Explicit Includes

Use the `includes` field to explicitly merge other config files into your job:

```python
FlowJob(
    includes=["defaults_flow.py"],
    log_dir="./logs/flow_test",
    tasks=["my_task"]
)
```

Included configs are merged recursively, with the current config's values taking precedence over included values. For dictionaries, fields are merged deeply. For lists, items are concatenated with duplicates removed.

### Automatic Discovery

Inspect Flow automatically discovers and includes files named `_flow.py` in parent directories. Starting from your config file's location, it searches upward through the directory tree for `_flow.py` files and automatically merges them as base configurations.

This allows you to define shared defaults (model settings, dependencies, etc.) at a repository root that apply to all configs in subdirectories without explicit includes.
