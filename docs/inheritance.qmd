Inspect Flow supports configuration inheritance through two mechanisms:

## Explicit Includes

Use the `includes` field to explicitly merge other config files into your job:

```python
FlowJob(
    includes=["defaults.py"],
    log_dir="logs",
    tasks=["my_task"]
)
```

### Merge

Included configs are merged recursively, with the current config's values taking precedence over included values:

- **Dictionaries**: Fields are merged deeply (recursive merge)
- **Lists**: Items are concatenated with duplicates removed
- **Scalars**: Current config values override included values

### Order

Includes are processed sequentially in the order they appear. When multiple includes are specified, later includes take precedence over earlier ones.

### Recursion

Included files can themselves have `includes` fields, which are expanded recursively. This allows you to build hierarchies of configuration.

### Path Resolution

Relative paths will be resolved relative to the config file (when using the CLI) or `base_dir` arg (when using the API). You can use either simple string paths or `FlowInclude` objects to specify the path to the flow config to include:

``` {.python filename="config.py"}
{{< include ../examples/includes.py >}}
```

## Automatic Discovery

Inspect Flow automatically discovers and includes files named `_flow.py` in parent directories. Starting from your config file's location, it searches upward through the directory tree for `_flow.py` files and automatically merges them as base configurations.

This allows you to define shared defaults (model settings, dependencies, etc.) at a repository root that apply to all configs in subdirectories without explicit includes.
