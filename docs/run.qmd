Once you've defined your Flow configuration, you can execute evaluations using the `flow run` command. Flow also provides tools for previewing configurations and controlling runtime behavior.

## The `flow run` Command

Execute your evaluation workflow:

``` bash
flow run config.py
```

**What happens when you run this:**

1.  Flow loads your configuration file
2.  Creates an isolated virtual environment
3.  Installs dependencies
4.  Resolves all defaults and matrix expansions
5.  Executes evaluations via Inspect AI's `eval_set()`
6.  Stores logs in `log_dir`
7.  Cleans up the temporary environment

### Common CLI Flags

**Preview without running:**

``` bash
flow run config.py --dry-run
```

Shows the completely resolved configuration:

- Creates virtual environment
- Applies all defaults 
- Expands all matrix functions 
- Instantiates all Python objects

This is invaluable for debugging what settings will actually be used in your evaluations.

**Override log directory:**

``` bash
flow run config.py --log-dir ./experiments/baseline
```

Changes where logs and results are stored.

**Runtime overrides:**

``` bash
flow run config.py \
  --set options.limit=100 \
  --set defaults.config.temperature=0.5
```

Override any configuration value at runtime. See [CLI Overrides](defaults.qmd#cli-overrides) for more details.

## The `flow config` Command

Preview your configuration before running:

``` bash
flow config config.py
```

Displays the parsed configuration as YAML with CLI overrides applied. Does not create a virtual environment or instantiate Python objects.

### When to Use Each Command

-   **`flow config`** - Quick syntax check, verify overrides
-   **`flow run --dry-run`** - Debug defaults resolution, inspect final settings
-   **`flow run`** - Execute evaluations
:::

## Running from Python

You can run Flow evaluations programmatically using the Python API:

``` {.python filename="run.py"}
{{< include ../examples/python.py >}}
```

The `inspect_flow.api` module provides three functions:

- **`run()`** - Execute a Flow spec with full environment setup (equivalent to `flow run`)
- **`load_spec()`** - Load a Flow configuration from a Python file into a `FlowSpec` object
- **`config()`** - Get the resolved configuration as YAML (equivalent to `flow config`)

See the [API Reference](reference/inspect_flow.api.qmd) for detailed parameter documentation.

## Results and Logs

### Logs Directory

Evaluation results are stored in the `log_dir`:

```
logs/
├── 2025-11-21T17-38-20+01-00_gpqa-diamond_KvJBGowidXSCLRhkKQbHYA.eval
├── 2025-11-21T17-38-20+01-00_mmlu-0-shot_Vnu2A3M2wPet5yobLiCQmZ.eval
├── .eval-set-id
├── eval-set.json
├── flow.yaml
├── flow-requirements.txt
└── ...
```

**Directory structure:**

-   Flow passes the `log_dir` directly to Inspect AI `eval_set()` for evaluation log storage
-   Inspect AI handles the actual evaluation log file naming and storage
-   Log file naming conventions follow Inspect AI's standards (see [Inspect AI logging docs](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/eval-logs.html#log-file-name))
-   Flow automatically saves the resolved configuration as `flow.yaml` in the log directory
-   Flow saves the exact version of packages installed in the virtual environment as `flow-requirements.txt`
-   The `.eval-set-id` file contains the eval set identifier
-   The `eval-set.json` file contains eval set metadata

**Log formats:**

-   `.eval` - Binary Inspect AI log format (default, high-performance)
-   `.json` - JSON format (if `log_format="json"` in `FlowOptions`)

### Viewing Results

**Using [Inspect View](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/log-viewer.html):**

``` bash
inspect view
```

Opens the Inspect AI viewer to explore evaluation logs interactively.
[Inspect View](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/log-viewer.html) can automatically detect Flow config files in the log directory and render them in the UI, making it easier to review the spec for the evaluations.

Click the Flow icon in the top right hand corner to view the Flow config.

### S3 Support

Store logs directly to S3:

``` python
FlowSpec(
    log_dir="s3://my-bucket/experiments/baseline",
    tasks=[...]
)
```

For more information on configuring an S3 bucket as a logs directory, refer to the Inspect AI [documentation](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/eval-logs.html#sec-amazon-s3).
